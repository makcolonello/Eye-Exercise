Description:
In this exercise I employed CSS style sheet as well as JavaScript logic to create two eyes that move with the cursor.  As you move your cursor, the pupils of the eys will move with the cursor inside the boundaries of the eye. 

How To Run:
In your index.html file you will need to link your css style sheet as well as the js (JavaScript) file. This will load the colors and shapes as well as the functionality of your eyes into the browser.

Improvements:
To improve this exercise, I think it would be interesting to add a click element where the eyes wink at you with one click or blink at you with 2 clicks.  I believe this would be employed in the code with adding more classses to the css style sheet (.toplid, .bottomlid) to create the shapes needed for the eye to close.  The JavaScript logic would need to have functions to make the clicking element work.  I believe the index.html file would also need a button tag for the user to press on the eye to start the interactive winking and blinking.
