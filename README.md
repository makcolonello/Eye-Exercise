# Eye-Exercise

My Eyes Description:
In this exercise I employed CSS style sheet as well as JavaScript logic to create two eyes that move with the cursor.  As you move your cursor, the pupils of the eys will move with the cursor inside the boundaris of the eye. 

How To Run:
Simply load the index.html file into chrome. There should be two eyes centered on the page that move with the cursor as if they are watching and following you. 

Improvements:
To improve this exercise, I think it would be interesting to add a click element where the eyes wink at you with one click or blink at you with 2 clicks.  I believe this would be employed in the code with adding more classses to the css style sheet (.toplid, .bottomlid) to create the shapes needed for the eye to close.  The JavaScript logic would need to have functions to make the clicking element work.  I believe the index.html file would also need a button tag for the user to press on the eye to start the interactive winking and blinking.
